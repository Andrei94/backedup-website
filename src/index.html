    <div>
      <div>Here's a question for you:
        <h5>Why do you buy an external hard disk or a subscription for a cloud storage?</h5>
      </div>
      <div>Because you want more space or you want to make sure that what you have is protected from damage right?</div>
      <br>
      <div>Here’s a thing: Cloud storage backs up your data, but only the data that you have <b>in a specific
        location</b>,
        not everything.
      </div>
      <div>You must move your files and folders to where the cloud storage folder is and this is not always possible.
      </div>
      <div>Don’t think this is true? Move some critical operating system files there and see what happens.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Having a cloud storage folder on your computer also takes up of your <b>own disk space</b>.</div>
      <br>
      <div>For example, if you have a 500GB hard disk and you want to buy a cloud storage of 1TB, you wouldn’t be
        able to use it all, because you wouldn’t have the <b>necessary space to put everything there</b>.
      </div>
      <div>Now you might go with external hard disk drives but here’s the thing: they still break. Whether they are
        external or internal, <b>they still break and you don’t know when that will happen</b>.
      </div>
      <div>So your best bet is to have multiple of them to make sure that when one of them breaks you still have your
        data right?.
      </div>
      <div>You could say, "Well I have my internal hard disk and my external hard disk, so <b>I’m safe</b>"<b> and you’d
        be
        right and perfectly
        OK</b>.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>Now let me ask you this:
        <h5>What do you do to have your internal hdd in sync with your external hdd?</h5>
      </div>
      <div>Periodic backups? Manual copy & paste of new files? That works if you <b>assume</b> that the
        problem can’t happen in between backups, that the hard disk doesn’t break in between your last backup and the
        time your new backup is performed.
      </div>
      <div>Remember Murphy's Law?</div>
      <div>And that is the <b>very assumption</b> that made us create <b>Backedup</b>.</div>
    </div>

    <div>
      Having your space as an external hard disk means that you can use the tool of your choice to work on files. You
      see, we don’t believe in using <b>custom made collaboration tools</b> for very good reasons: they need to be <b>learnt
      by you</b> in order to be used at their full potential and they are <b>a workaround solution to the lack of access
      to your files </b> by the tools that you are <b>most comfortable with</b>. Having access to your files means you
      can use what tool you are most comfortable with to work on your files.
    </div>
    <div>
      Other solutions provide either file management or backups of systems. We provide them both. You have the option to
      choose which files you want to backup and which files you want to use for your everyday work.
    </div>

  <section>
    <h5>How safe is Backedup?</h5>
    <div><b>All</b> data transmitted <b>from you to our servers</b> is encrypted using industry standard algorithms.
      Once arrived, <b>multiple encrypted copies</b> of your files are stored on different servers.
      Thus, if <b>one of our the servers crashes</b>, your data is safe and sound. Another server will replace the one
      that crashed, thus <b>guaranteeing</b> that your data will not be lost.
