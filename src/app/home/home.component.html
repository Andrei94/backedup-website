    <div>
      <div>Here's a question for you:
        <div class="h5">Why do you buy a subscription for a cloud storage or an external hard disk?</div>
      </div>
      <div>Because you want more space or you want to make sure that what you have is protected from damage right?</div>
      <br>
      <div>Here’s a thing: Cloud storage backs up your data, but the data that you have <b>in a specific location</b>,
        not everything.
      </div>
      <div>You must move your files and folders to where the cloud storage folder is and this is not always possible.
      </div>
      <div>Don’t think this is true? Move some critical operating system files there and see what happens.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Having a cloud storage folder on your computer also takes up of your <b>own disk space</b>.</div>
      <br>
      <div>For example, if you have a 500GB hard disk and you want to buy a cloud storage of 1TB, you wouldn’t be
        able to use it all, because you wouldn’t have the <b>necessary space to put everything there</b>.
      </div>
      <div>Now you might go with external hard disk drives but here’s the thing: they still break. Whether they are
        external or internal, <b>they still break and you don’t know when that will happen</b>.
      </div>
      <div>So your best bet is to have multiple of them to make sure that when one of them breaks you still have your
        data right?.
      </div>
      <div>You could say, "Well I have my internal hard disk and my external hard disk, so <b>I’m safe" and you’d be
        right and perfectly
        OK</b>.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>Now let me ask you this:
        <div class="h5">What do you do to have your internal hdd in sync with your external hdd?</div>
      </div>
      <div>Periodic backups? Manual copy & paste of new files? That works if you <b>assume</b> that the
        problem can’t happen in between backups, that the hard disk doesn’t break in between your last backup and the
        time your new backup is performed.
      </div>
      <div>Remember Murphy's Law?</div>
      <div>And that is the <b>very assumption</b> that made us create <b>Backedup</b>.</div>
